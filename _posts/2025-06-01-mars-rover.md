From 2021-2025, I was involved in an undergraduate engineering organiziation comprised of 30-50 engineering students, [Yonder Dynamics](https://yonderdynamics.org/#/), that competed in the annual [University Rover Challenge](https://urc.marssociety.org/). During my first two years, I contributed to the mechanical design and fabrication of rover parts; specifically, I led the design a differential linkage system, which continues to be a core structural member of the rover.

During my later years on the team, I served in various leadership positions where I focused on system integration, mentorship, and project management. Additionally, I personally created and hosted workshops on introductory robotics topics like CAD, FEA, motor controllers, and serial communication protocols since the team emphasized the open, hands-on education for students new to engineering.
